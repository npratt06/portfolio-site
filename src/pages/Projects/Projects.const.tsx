            Spinball is a competitive couch multiplayer video game that some friends and I created.
            It was originally built with JavaScript and can be purchased on Steam. I contributed to
            the game design, completed programming tasks, and helped create some art assets. I also created
            the soundtrack ðŸŽµ!

            Zomboozled is a small video game that I created by myself in college as a challenge to see what I could fit into
            a single HTML file. I created this game using pure HTML/JavaScript. It was a very fun project and I would love
            to go back and refactor/build upon it.
